This package contains modules for different UI sections of the Streamlit application.

# You can optionally import key classes or functions here to make them
# available at the package level, e.g.:
# from .ui_planner import PlannerUI
# from .ui_learner import LearnerUI

# Or just leave it empty if direct imports from submodules are preferred.
